## Polishing our bot further
Firstly we had to increase the dataset. We are using .aiml markup language to store our data.
Secondly we improved our machine learning models.
and Finally to bring Sensei to life we used Flask framework to connect backend to frontend, HTML 5 and CSS 3 for frontend.

### Fianlly Sensei is up and running
